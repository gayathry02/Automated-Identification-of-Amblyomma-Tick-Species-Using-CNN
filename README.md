# Automated-Identification-of-Amblyomma-Tick-Species-Using-CNN
The objective of this project is to automatically classify six species of Amblyomma ticks using convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The performance of three different models—AlexNet, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2—is evaluated and compared using a common dataset.
